    "Currently there are many accidents occurring due to various factors which cause a loss of property and life itself. This report is produced with an objective to reduce such occurrences by providing the stakeholders with prediction and likelihood of accident given the environmental factors such as weather and lighting. This will help deter accidents which can be avoided if correct information is available at the correct time. This would be helpful to the police department, road authorities and mainly drivers."
